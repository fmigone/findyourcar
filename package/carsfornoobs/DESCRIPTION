Description: This package uses data from paruvendu.com scrapped during October and November of 2019 to analyse the components of the prices of a car.
    It is meant to help anyone find the perfect car at a perfect price and reduce information asymmetry regarding second-hand cars.
    The Shiny app provides an interface for that.
